IB Computer Science 2
Firebase Studio supplement

These worksheets assume local execution on macOS. If you are using the Google Firebase
Studio GNU/Linux cloud environment, make the following adjustments.

Application-layer protocols

Worksheet step (2)

    1. Linux does not allow binding to low port numbers. Instead of binding to the standard
         HTTP port, bind to one of the alternate HTTP ports with the command: nc -l 8080

    2. Firebase will immediately make a request to the Web server, causing it to print several
         lines of text. Restart it by pressing Ctrl+C then rerunning the same command; this time
         no additional lines should print.

    3. Instead of going to localhost/file, copy the URL by opening the Firebase Studio
         panel on the left, expanding Backend Ports, and clicking the Copy to clipboard button
         next to port 8080.

    4. Open a new browser tab, paste the URL, add a /file to the end, and hit enter. After
         noting down what happens, leave the tab open but switch back to the Firebase Studio.

Worksheet step (4)

Visiting the page caused a request for: http://127.0.0.1:8080/file
Use this information to answer the question.

Concurrency

Worksheet step (7)

Instead of opening Activity Monitor, click the Split Terminal button in the upper-right corner of
the Firebase Studio terminal. In the new terminal, run the command: top

Memory allocation

Extra time

Instead of opening Activity Monitor, click the Split Terminal button in the upper-right corner of
the Firebase Studio terminal. In the new terminal, run the command: top
Virtual memory

Note that the Virtual memory and Paging sections do not work on Firebase Studio because of a
platform-imposed limit on the amount of lockable memory. To use them, students would have to
be working locally on a macOS or GNU/Linux system.

Signals

Instead of running man signal, use man 7 signal
