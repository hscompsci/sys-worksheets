Parallelism worksheet

Whereas concurrency is executing tasks during overlapping time windows, parallelism is
executing them truly simultaneously. Parallelism therefore requires multiple CPU cores, whether
on the same processor, multiple processors on the same motherboard, or multiple servers
connected via a network to form a supercomputer or distributed system.

Download our merge sort implementation from the recursion unit, including the merge algorithm
that it depends on. Place them in the folder where you usually write activity code.

   1. Remove all the prints and time the mergeSort() method call using
      System.currentTimeMillis(). Run it to ensure that the only output is the
      measurement. How long does it take to sort the array?


   2. Increase the array size to 100 million elements, or as large as you can make it without
      your machine barfing. How long does it take to sort this array?


Make a copy of the program called ParallelMergeSort.java. Create a global thread pool
like we just did as a class. Modify your mergeSort() method implementation to .submit()
Callable<>s to the global thread pool instead of directly recursing, then .get() their results
just before performing the merge step.

   3. Once you have resolved the compiler warnings, run the program. What happens?
      Looking at the warning messages, what do you think is going wrong?




Kill the program by hitting Ctrl+Z then running the command kill -kill %1. We will need to
be more careful about the number of threads we spawn, to avoid overwhelming the operating
system with an exponential explosion in the number of running tasksâ€¦

   4. Replace the Executors.newCachedThreadPool() call with an
      Executors.newWorkStealingPool(), which caps the number of threads at the
      number of CPU cores (the maximum possible parallelism). How long does it take now?
      Note: If it is not faster, discuss your code as a group to ensure it makes sense. If you are
      stuck, seek assistance from a group that has finished.


   5. What features of the merge sort algorithm make it well suited to parallelization?
